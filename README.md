👋 namaste, i’m @ansh13579!  
👀 i’m a tech enthusiast diving deep into ai/ml, llms, deep learning, and data science — basically anything that makes machines smarter!  
🌱 i’m currently learning about large language models (llms) and exploring their magic, while pursuing mechanical engineering at iit bhu (yes, i’m a mech guy who loves code).  
💞️ i’m looking to collaborate on ml projects — let’s build something cool like a predictive model or a chatbot together!   
😄 pronouns: he/him.  
⚡ fun fact: i once tried to train a model to predict canteen food quality at iit bhu, but it kept saying “khana thik hi hai”!
